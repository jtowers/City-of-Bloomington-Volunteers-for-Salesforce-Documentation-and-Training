I have edited, reorganized and added screenshots to the documentation for the Volunteers for Salesforce app (by Groundwire).

This project is for users who wish to make further changes (or just be able to read through or distribute documentation without my name in the header of each page).

The project contains the following folders:

1. Documentation: this is my edited documentation. The contained file is a Lyx document (http://www.lyx.org/). 

2. Copyright: This stores the image for the Creative Commons license used in the Lyx file. 

3. Provided documentation: If you wish to refer to the documentation that this project is based on, I have included it in this folder.
